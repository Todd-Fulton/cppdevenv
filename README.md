# WIP: Warning !!! This is a Work in Progress

A set of Dockerfiles and a bake script for generating a few toolchains and build environments
for bleeding-edge C++20/23 development.


## Future Goals:

### Weaver
A source package manager using docker for reproducible builds.

Why weaver? There are birds called social weavers that build elaborate nests. Weaver will attempt to weave all the sources together in a systematic fashion to build a "nest", an environment for applications and development.
