# WIP: Warning !!! This is a Work in Progress

A set of scripts for bleeding-edge C++20/23 development.


## Future Goals:

### Weaver
A source package manager using docker for reproducible builds.

Why weaver? There are birds called social weavers that build elaborate nests. Weaver will attempt to weave all the sources together in a systematic fashion to build a "nest", an environment for applications and development.

#### Core principles and guiding philosophy of Weaver:
- Minimalistic. Weaver wont give you what you don't ask for.
- Configurable. Weaver will allow you to tweak every knob in the system.
- Fluid. Weaver will track dependencies and enable options needed throughout the stack.
- Clean. Weaver wont leave trash behind in your target system.
- Declarative. Weaver just needs users to declare what they want.
